Letter of Explanation
Date: 10/25/2023
To: Underwriting Department
From: John Doe
Subject: Explanation of Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF)

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to explain the NSF fee that appears on my bank statement dated 09/15/2023.

This was an isolated incident caused by an automatic payment for my gym membership processing one day before my direct deposit arrived. I have since updated the billing date to ensure this does not happen again.

I have maintained a positive balance since then and have sufficient reserves.

Sincerely,
John Doe
